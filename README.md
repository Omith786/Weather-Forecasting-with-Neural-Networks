# Weather-Forecasting-with-Neural-Networks

This project is a weather forecasting application powered by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, trained on a large historical dataset of meteorological records. The aim was to capture the sequential patterns in weather data and provide short-term forecasts that are both accurate and interpretable.

Unlike traditional statistical models, which often struggle with long-range dependencies, LSTMs are specifically designed to remember and utilise information across time. This makes them well-suited to weather prediction, where todayâ€™s conditions are deeply influenced by patterns from days, weeks, or even months prior. By feeding the model years of historical temperature, humidity, and pressure data, it learns to identify seasonal cycles, short-term fluctuations, and anomalies.

The application presents these forecasts in a clean and accessible way. Users can input a location and see predicted conditions such as temperature trends and rainfall probability over the coming days. While the project is primarily a machine learning exercise, it also doubles as a practical tool, showing how deep learning can be applied to everyday problems.

One of the unique aspects of this project is the balance between technical depth and usability. The backend focuses on building a robust LSTM model with tuned hyperparameters, while the frontend ensures results are easy to interpret for non-technical users. Together, this makes the app both an educational showcase of recurrent neural networks and a working demonstration of applied AI in the field of meteorology.
